# Bunny-game
This project now contains a simple stopwatch game with an online leaderboard.

## Running

Use Node.js to start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

The game will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. Stop the timer on an
exact multiple of 5 seconds and submit your name to appear on the shared
leaderboard stored on the server.
